Privacy Policy

1. Introduction
   - This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information related to the School-Based Management System application (the "Application").

2. Data Collection
   - The application primarily collects data related to API usage. No personal user details are collected by the application itself. Relevant user information is stored on the organization's specified Google Drive address.

3. Data Use
   - The information we collect is used to:
     - Provide, operate, and maintain the application.
     - Improve, personalize, and expand the application.
     - Understand and analyze how you use the application.
     - Develop new products, services, features, and functionality.

4. Data Sharing
   - Since the application only stores API usage statistics and does not store data on its own storage or the developer's data collection storage, data sharing is limited to the following circumstance:
     - For Legal Reasons: We may share API usage statistics if we believe it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, or protect the safety of our users.

5. Data Security
   - We implement measures to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. You use the application at your own risk.

6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
   - We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes may be made to reflect new legal requirements, changes in our practices, or improvements in our services. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
